# Java-Web-Server
Web Server that handles HTTP requests written in Java.
For this server a thread is created when each connection is opened.


Any kind of file can be sent over the socket connection, just needs to be in the same directory when running.

(SSL is not implemented in this demo, even though in normal socket connections SSL would be used)
